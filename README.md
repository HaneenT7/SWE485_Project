# Arabic Movie Recommendation System


Project Motivation

Arabic cinema, especially Egyptian movies, has a rich history but lacks modern digital tools for movie discovery and personalization.
This project aims to analyze Arabic movie data and build a recommendation system that helps users find films matching their preferences (e.g., genre, actors, directors, or duration).

The dataset (CIMA.xlsx) contains 2,368 Egyptian movies, including details like title, release year, genre, duration, synopsis, and crew members.
Through data exploration and preprocessing, we cleaned and prepared the data to support machine learning models for genre prediction and recommendation.
